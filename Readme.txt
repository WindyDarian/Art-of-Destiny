This is the game I created with Microsoft XNA Game Studio im my 2nd year of high school in my spare time, The code I wrote 5 years ago is a mess...I admit.
I ported this to Visual Studio 2013 and XNA refresh 4.0 (https://msxna.codeplex.com/releases/view/117230), replaced some inappropriate resources.
Now I am translating it to English, and then I can use it in my portfolio:)

How to play:
Keyboard(Xbox gamepad):
W(LS):	Thrust engine on/off
S(B):	Brake
E(X):	Loot
Q(Y):	Lock
Space(A) Hold:	Auto Aim
1,2,3,4(DPad Up,Right,Down,Left): Switch Weapon
Right Mouse Button (LT): Aim Camera
Left Mouse Button (RT): Shoot
R(LB): Special Module
F(RB): Missile

The game is hard though...
